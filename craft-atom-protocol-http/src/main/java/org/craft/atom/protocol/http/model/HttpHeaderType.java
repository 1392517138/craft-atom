	 * extended with keep-alive connections for control information.In HTTP/1.1,
	 * the older semantics are mostly recognized, but the header has taken on a

	 * HTTP has a few specific date formats. This one is defined in RFC 822 and

	 * specifications of HTTP, the date format was not spelled out as well, so
	 * server and client implementors have used other formats, which need to be
	 * supported for the sake of legacy. You will run into date formats like the
